v0.80.11
--------

- The return code for librbd's rbd_aio_read and Image::aio_read API methods no
  longer returns the number of bytes read upon success.  Instead, it returns 0
  upon success and a negative value upon failure.

v0.81
-----

- Disallow nonsensical 'tier cache-mode' transitions.  From this point
  onward, 'writeback' can only transition to 'forward' and 'forward'
  can transition to 1) 'writeback' if there are dirty objects, or 2) any if
  there are no dirty objects.
